# Design Documents

This section contains the high-level design specifications that serve as the blueprint for the game's features and systems. Our design process is guided by a set of core principles that ensure a cohesive and engaging player experience.

## 🏛️ Design Pillars

Our design philosophy is built on the following pillars, which are inspired by the core experience of *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019)*:

- **⚡ Snappy Responsiveness:** Player input should translate into immediate and satisfying action. This pillar influences everything from movement mechanics to UI feedback.
- **🧠 Tactical Depth:** The game should offer a wide range of strategic options. This is supported by features like the Gunsmith system, diverse equipment, and multi-faceted map design.
- **🎨 Cinematic Realism:** We aim for a high level of visual and audio fidelity that immerses the player in a believable world. This includes realistic weapon animations, sound design, and environmental effects.
- **⚖️ Fair & Balanced Gameplay:** All gameplay mechanics, from weapon stats to map layouts, should be balanced to provide a fair and competitive experience for all players.

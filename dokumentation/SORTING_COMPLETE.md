This document previously served as a report detailing the completion of documentation sorting and README consistency. It has now been **superseded by the more comprehensive [README_VERIFICATION.md](README_VERIFICATION.md) and [INDEX.md](INDEX.md)**, which provide a holistic view of the current documentation structure, content, and vision alignment.

This file is retained for historical reference only and should no longer be considered an authoritative source for current documentation status.

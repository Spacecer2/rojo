# Asset List: Killstreaks

## System Design & Vision

The Killstreak system is a cornerstone of our game's reward loop, designed to amplify moments of player skill and create dramatic shifts in the battlefield. These are not merely powerful tools; they are dynamic elements that force strategic adaptation, reward aggressive play, and contribute significantly to the game's overall narrative and excitement.

## 🔥 Killstreak Tiers

Killstreaks are earned by achieving a specific number of consecutive eliminations without being eliminated yourself. This tiered system ensures a progressive reward for sustained skilled performance.

### 3 Kills
-   **Personal Radar**: Deploys an escort drone that pings nearby enemies on your minimap. *Vision: Provides immediate, localized intelligence, rewarding short-term positional awareness and aggressive pushes.*
-   **Shield Turret**: A deployable, manual turret that offers mobile, defensive firepower. *Vision: Offers flexible area denial or temporary fortification, allowing for tactical repositioning or covering vulnerable teammates.*

### 4 Kills
-   **UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle)**: A recon plane that sweeps the area, revealing enemy locations on the minimap for a limited duration. *Vision: A fundamental tactical advantage, providing crucial broader situational awareness for the entire squad, essential for mid-game rotations and engagements.*
-   **Counter UAV**: Launches a drone that actively scrambles enemy minimaps within its radius, denying their situational awareness. *Vision: A strategic counter-play to enemy reconnaissance, temporarily blinding opponents and creating opportunities for flanking or disengaging.*

### 5 Kills
-   **Cluster Strike**: Calls in a localized mortar barrage on a designated area. *Vision: An area-denial tool, effective for flushing out entrenched enemies, clearing objectives, or forcing opponents out of cover. Requires precise targeting and timing.*
-   **Cruise Missile**: Allows direct remote control of a high-explosive missile from a first-person perspective. *Vision: Rewards player skill with a high-impact, direct-strike capability, ideal for eliminating specific threats or clearing choke points.*

### 7 Kills
-   **Precision Airstrike**: Calls in twin jets for a strafing run along a designated path. *Vision: A more focused and rapid area-denial tool compared to the Cluster Strike, excellent for clearing long lines of sight or suppressing enemy advances.*
-   **Wheelson**: Deploys a remote-controlled, armored UGV (Unmanned Ground Vehicle) equipped with a powerful turret. *Vision: A mobile, offensive platform that can aggressively push enemy positions, suppress fire, or provide forward reconnaissance. Its durability forces enemies to focus fire.*

### 10 Kills
-   **Chopper Gunner**: Grants control of a powerful assault helicopter's turret for a limited time, allowing the player to engage enemies from above. *Vision: A high-tier offensive powerhouse, offering unparalleled area control and direct elimination potential. Rewards sustained high-level play with a significant, but temporary, shift in combat advantage.*
-   **Emergency Airdrop**: Calls in three random care packages to a designated location. *Vision: A high-risk, high-reward option that introduces an element of unpredictability. It can provide critical resources or game-changing killstreaks, but also attracts enemy attention.*

### 15 Kills
-   **Juggernaut**: Calls in a care package containing a suit of heavy armor and a powerful minigun. *Vision: The ultimate reward for exceptional, sustained performance. Transforms the player into a formidable, slow-moving tank, capable of pushing objectives and drawing significant enemy fire, fundamentally altering the late-game dynamic.*

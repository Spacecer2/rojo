# Asset List: Operators

## System Design & Vision

The Operator system is a cornerstone of our game's identity, player expression, and cosmetic monetization strategy. Operators are more than just character models; they are the visual avatars through which players experience the game, and as such, their design and presentation are critical. Our philosophy is that Operators provide a canvas for player customization and a powerful vehicle for building brand loyalty through iconic, recognizable characters.

# Asset List: Equipment

## System Design & Vision

The equipment system is a critical layer of tactical depth in our game. Each piece of equipment is meticulously designed not just to deal damage or provide information, but to create a rich tapestry of strategic plays, counter-plays, and dynamic engagements. Our philosophy is that equipment should empower player agency, reward creative thinking, and constantly evolve the battlefield.

## 💣 Lethal Equipment
Offensive tools designed to eliminate enemies, create area denial, or force enemy repositioning. Each lethal offers distinct tactical advantages and drawbacks.

-   **Frag Grenade**: A cookable explosive with a radius blast. Its utility lies in timed detonation, enabling precise area denial or flushing out entrenched enemies.
-   **Semtex**: A timed explosive that sticks to surfaces and players. Ideal for rapid deployment and ensuring impact on mobile targets or vehicles.
-   **Molotov Cocktail**: An incendiary device that creates a temporary fire zone. Excellent for blocking narrow pathways, denying access to objectives, or pressuring enemies out of cover.
-   **Claymore**: A proximity-activated directional mine. Best used for setting traps, covering flanks, or securing rear positions. Requires careful placement to avoid friendly fire or easy detection.
-   **Throwing Knife**: A retrievable blade for one-hit kills in close quarters. Rewards precision and tactical stealth, offering a silent elimination option and resource conservation.

## 🔦 Tactical Equipment
Utility tools designed for information gathering, crowd control, or personal advantage. These items enhance situational awareness and offer non-lethal means to influence engagements.

-   **Flash Grenade**: Blinds and deafens targets for a short duration. Essential for initiating pushes into occupied areas or disorienting aggressive opponents.
-   **Stun Grenade**: Slows movement, reduces aim sensitivity, and distorts the screen of affected enemies. Effective for disabling multiple targets or setting up easy eliminations.
-   **Stim**: A quick-acting medical shot for immediate health regeneration and a brief movement speed burst. A personal clutch item for turning the tide in a losing gunfight or rapidly repositioning.
-   **Heartbeat Sensor**: A tablet that displays the proximity of nearby enemies within a limited range. Provides crucial real-time intelligence for pushing buildings or confirming enemy positions, but has a visible signature.
-   **Smoke Grenade**: Creates a dense smoke screen for concealment. Invaluable for crossing open terrain, reviving teammates in the open, or obscuring enemy sightlines during an assault or retreat.
-   **Decoy Grenade**: Mimics gunfire and radar signatures, creating false positives on enemy minimaps. Used to misdirect, distract, or draw fire from unsuspecting opponents.

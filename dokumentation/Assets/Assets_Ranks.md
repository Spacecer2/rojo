# Asset List: Ranks & Progression

## System Design & Vision

The Ranks and Progression system is a fundamental driver of long-term player engagement and a key mechanism for instilling a sense of accomplishment. It's designed to provide a structured journey of mastery, rewarding players for their investment of time and skill, and continually offering new goals and incentives. Our philosophy is that progression should be transparent, meaningful, and deeply integrated with all aspects of gameplay.

## 🎖️ Player Rank Progression (Enlisted Ranks)

This track represents a player's overall experience and dedication to the game. Advancing through these ranks unlocks fundamental gameplay features and customization options.

| Level | Rank Name | Unlock / Milestone |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1-3** | Private | Initial training phase, introduces basic game mechanics. Unlocks essential **Basic Loadouts** to get players accustomed to core weapon types. |
| **4** | Specialist | A critical milestone, unlocking **Create-a-Class**. This empowers players with agency over their loadouts and introduces the depth of the Gunsmith system. |
| **10** | Corporal | Unlocks **Killstreak Selection**, introducing a powerful layer of tactical decision-making and rewarding sustained performance within a match. |
| **20** | Sergeant | Expands strategic options with the unlocking of **Perk Slot 3**, allowing for more specialized and personalized playstyles. |
| **30** | Staff Sergeant | Further enhances tactical utility by unlocking **Tactical Equipment**. Players gain access to tools for information gathering, crowd control, and strategic deployment. |
| **40** | Master Sergeant | Provides access to **Advanced Muzzle Attachments** within the Gunsmith, enabling finer tuning of weapon performance and new visual customization options. |
| **55** | Commander | The pinnacle of the Enlisted Ranks. Reaching this level signifies a comprehensive understanding of core game mechanics and unlocks the ability to enter the **Prestige System**. |

## 📈 Prestige System

The Prestige system is designed for our most dedicated players, offering a cyclical path to long-term engagement and exclusive cosmetic rewards. It allows players to reset their Enlisted Rank progression in exchange for unique, prestigious items that showcase their veteran status.

-   **Prestige 1**: Awards a unique **Seasonal Emblem** and an exclusive **Weapon Blueprint**, signifying the player's initial commitment beyond the core progression.
-   **Prestige 2**: Unlocks a distinct **Operator Skin Variant**, providing a highly visible cosmetic representation of their continued dedication.
-   **Prestige 3**: Grants **Master Weapon Camo Access**, allowing players to apply a prestigious cosmetic finish across their entire weapon arsenal, a true mark of achievement.

## 🔫 Weapon Leveling

Each weapon features an independent progression track, designed to deepen player engagement with individual firearms and to gradually unlock the full potential of the Gunsmith system.

-   **Level 5**: Unlocks the **Optic Slot** in the Gunsmith, allowing players to choose from various sights to improve aiming precision and visual clarity.
-   **Level 15**: Unlocks the **Barrel Slot**, offering critical modifications that significantly alter weapon range, velocity, and recoil characteristics.
-   **Level 25**: Unlocks the **Magazine Slot**, providing options for increased ammo capacity or specialized ammunition types, fundamentally changing weapon utility.
*Vision: This granular unlocking mechanism encourages players to experiment with different weapons and understand the impact of each Gunsmith category. It provides a continuous sense of reward and mastery for weapon specialization.*

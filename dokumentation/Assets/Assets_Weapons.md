# Asset List: Weapons & Attachments

## System Design & Vision

The Weapon and Attachment system is the cornerstone of our combat experience, meticulously engineered to create a diverse, balanced, and dynamic combat meta. Our philosophy is that every weapon should feel distinct, filling a specific tactical niche, and that the attachment system should empower players with meaningful choices, not just linear upgrades. This design directly influences player strategy, engagement, and the long-term viability of the game's combat loop.

## 🔫 Weapons

Each weapon archetype is designed to offer a unique set of tactical advantages and disadvantages, fostering a diverse range of playstyles.

## 🛠️ Attachments (Gunsmith)

The Gunsmith system allows players to customize their weapons with up to 5 concurrent attachments across various slots. Each attachment is designed with meaningful trade-offs to prevent a single "meta" build and encourage player agency.

### Optics
Enhance aiming precision and target acquisition.

-   **Slimline Pro**: A compact red dot sight offering fast target acquisition and a clean sight picture. *Vision: Standard, all-purpose optic for improved accuracy without significant drawbacks.*
-   **VLK 4.0 Optic**: A 4.0x magnification optic that also provides improved recoil control. *Vision: Designed for mid-to-long range engagements, offering a trade-off between magnified view and slower ADS speed.*

### Muzzles
Modify sound signature, recoil control, and bullet velocity.

-   **Monolithic Suppressor**: Provides significant sound suppression and an increase in effective range and bullet velocity. *Vision: A critical attachment for stealth and long-range engagements, balancing concealment with potential reductions in ADS speed or stability.*
-   **Flash Guard**: Primarily hides muzzle flash, slightly improving weapon control. *Vision: Designed for players who prioritize visual stealth and maintain target visibility during sustained fire.*

### Barrels
Fundamentally alter a weapon's range, bullet velocity, and recoil characteristics.

-   **Tempus Hightower 20"**: A heavy, extended barrel that significantly increases range and bullet velocity, making the weapon more effective at longer distances. *Vision: For players who want to maximize a weapon's effective range, at the cost of mobility and ADS speed.*

### Magazines
Impact ammunition capacity and reload speed, with potential mobility trade-offs.

-   **45 Round Mag**: Increases ammunition capacity to 45 rounds, providing sustained fire capability. *Vision: Essential for suppressing fire and engaging multiple targets without frequent reloads, but often reduces mobility.*

### Underbarrels
Primarily affect weapon control, aiming stability, and hip-fire accuracy.

-   **Commando Foregrip**: Designed to stabilize horizontal recoil, improving overall weapon control. *Vision: A balanced choice for improving a weapon's predictability and ease of use in sustained fire.*

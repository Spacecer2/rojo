# ⚙️ System Features

System-level features are the foundational elements that provide players with control over their experience. A well-designed systems menu is crucial for player satisfaction, accessibility, and overall usability.

## 🎛️ The Settings Menu

The settings menu is the primary interface for player customization. Our goal is to create a menu that is clear, intuitive, and comprehensive, following best practices for UI/UX design.

### Key Design Principles
- **Accessibility:** The menu is designed with accessibility in mind, featuring options for colorblind modes, scalable text, and other features to ensure all players can have a comfortable experience.
- **Clarity:** Settings are organized into logical categories to prevent clutter and make options easy to find.
- **Consistency:** The visual design and terminology are consistent with the rest of the game's UI, creating a seamless experience.

### Settings Categories
The settings menu is divided into the following categories:

| Category | Description |
|---|---|
| **Controls** | Allows players to customize keybindings, mouse sensitivity, and controller layouts. Includes options for inverting the Y-axis and other control preferences. |
| **Audio** | Provides separate volume sliders for master, music, sound effects, and voice chat. Also includes options for audio output devices. |
| **Graphics** | Contains settings for resolution, display mode, graphics quality presets, and advanced options like shadow quality and anti-aliasing. |
| **Interface**| Allows players to customize the heads-up display (HUD), including the ability to show or hide elements like the minimap and player health. |
| **Accessibility**| Includes options for colorblind filters, subtitles, and other features to assist players with disabilities. |

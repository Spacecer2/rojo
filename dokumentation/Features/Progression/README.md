# 📊 Progression Systems

Progression systems are the backbone of our long-term player engagement strategy. They are designed to provide players with a sense of accomplishment, a reason to keep playing, and a way to express themselves through cosmetic rewards.

## System Design & Vision

The progression systems are designed with the following principles in mind:

- **Rewarding Time and Investment:** Our goal is to create a system that rewards players for their time and investment in the game, whether they are a casual player who logs in a few times a week or a hardcore player who plays every day. The Battle Pass, with its free and premium tracks, is designed to provide a steady stream of rewards for all types of players.
- **A Sense of Accomplishment:** The progression systems are designed to provide a clear sense of accomplishment. Leveling up, completing challenges, and unlocking new tiers in the Battle Pass all provide tangible feedback to the player, making them feel like they are making progress and achieving their goals.
- **Player Expression:** The rewards from the progression systems are primarily cosmetic, allowing players to express themselves and show off their achievements without affecting gameplay balance. This includes operator skins, weapon blueprints, calling cards, and emblems.
- **A Fair and Transparent System:** The reward systems are designed to be fair and transparent. The probabilities for supply drops are clearly communicated, and a "pity mechanic" ensures that players will always receive a high-rarity item after a certain number of opens.

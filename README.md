# Roblox Warzone MW 2019 Recreation

A high-fidelity recreation of the **Modern Warfare 2019 / Warzone** experience within the Roblox engine. This project focuses on delivering "AAA-feel" movement, tight gunplay, and a modular architecture that pushes the boundaries of the platform.

## 🎯 The Vision
To bring the iconic, snappy, and weighty feel of *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019)* to Roblox. This isn't just a clone; it's a technical demonstration of how modular systems and physics-driven procedural animation can elevate Roblox gameplay.

### Core Pillars
- **⚡ Snappy Responsiveness**: Immediate feedback to player intent. If it feels delayed, it's wrong.
- **🧩 Modular Architecture**: Decoupled systems (Input, State, Movement, Animation) for easy maintenance and expansion.
- **🎨 Visual Fidelity**: Warzone-style UI, procedural weapon sway, and fluid animation blending.
- **⚖️ Competitive Integrity**: Client-side prediction with strict server-side validation.

## 🏗️ System Architecture
The project is built on a "State-Driven" philosophy where logic is separated into distinct layers:

1. **Input Manager**: Normalizes `ContextActionService` and `UserInputService` into intent signals.
2. **State Machine**: The "Brain" that determines the character's status (Sprinting, Sliding, ADS, etc.) and syncs via **Instance Attributes**.
3. **Movement Controller**: Translates states into physical forces and `Humanoid` properties.
4. **Animation Manager**: Handles track playback and blending based on state changes.
5. **Procedural Animator**: Adds "juice" through springs for sway, tilt, and bobbing.

## 🚀 Current Progress

### Phase 1: Foundation (COMPLETED)
- [x] Rojo-managed project structure.
- [x] Robust Input/State Machine framework.
- [x] Basic Locomotion (Walk/Run/Sprint/Jump).
- [x] Network & Data Persistence framework.
- [x] Main Menu & Loadout UI infrastructure.

### Phase 2: Combat & Fluidity (IN PROGRESS)
- [x] **ADS System**: Dynamic FOV and speed scaling.
- [ ] **Slide Mechanic**: Momentum-based sliding with friction reduction.
- [ ] **Advanced Animation**: Layered blending and footstep events.
- [ ] **Gunsmith System**: Modular attachment framework.

## 🛠️ Technical Highlights
- **Attribute-Based Sync**: Using Roblox Attributes as a decoupled "Value Object" for state synchronization.
- **Spring Physics**: Utilizing custom Spring modules for smooth, organic camera and weapon motion.
- **Defensive Design**: Using `pcall` and `task.spawn` for a robust initialization sequence that prevents "infinite-yield" hangs.

## Getting Started
To build the place from scratch, use:

```bash
rojo build -o "Projects.rbxlx"
```

Next, open `Projects.rbxlx` in Roblox Studio and start the Rojo server:

```bash
rojo serve
```
